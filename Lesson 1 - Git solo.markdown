#Git - local repository
__Goal:__ To teach the basics of git and why git is useful for an individual to use. This does not touch any of the server pieces.

__Overview:__ Throughout the lesson, we use examples from writing a paper to explain a git repository. Concepts explained are:
* Why you want a versions control system
* Git basics
	* Git init
	* Git add
	* Commits and commit messages
	* Git revert
* Git exercise

##Why you want a versions control system
Using an example, explain a scenario where someone may change something and then want to get back to the original. This example should be something the students can relate to. For this example, below, I am using the scenario of writing a paper.

__Teacher:__ How many of you have ever written an essay by hand?

__Students:__ [All raise their hands]

__Teacher:__ Stand up if you have ever been writing an essay, and you decide a something is not good. So you erase it?

__Students:__ [A bunch of the students stand up]

__Teacher:__ Stay standing, if you have ever wanted to get that thing you erased back. Maybe you realized that a sentence in it was great, or maybe you realized you never should have erased it.

__Students:__ [Some sit down]

__Teacher:__ Anybody want to share their story?

__Student:__ [A student tells a story about wanting to get their deleted content back]

__Teacher:__ How many of you have ever done the same thing on a computer? You typed something, deleted it, and then wanted it back.

__Students:__ [A bunch raise their hands]

__Teacher:__ Can you guys think of any ways that we could solve this problem on a computer? [If needed, give a hint of "maybe something with the way you save files"]

__Students:__ [Come to the idea of saving old files as different names]

__Teacher:__ This would work, and it is what we call versioning. Do you guys all know what versions are?

__Students:__ [Someone explains what versions are]

__Teacher:__ [Draw an example of a file versioning - show adding many files and how it gets messy]

__Teacher:__ Do you guys think this would be a good way of doing things?

__Students:__ No

__Teacher:__ Do you guys remember the different files that you used to make a website?

__Students:__ Yes, Index.html, style.css, P5.js etc.

__Teacher:__ How confusing would it be if you kept renaming your files and adding more to the folder. You would have StyleV1.css - StyleV20.css. Not only that, but you would need to change each reference to that file as you rename the latest version. A big mess huh?

__Teacher:__ Fortunately, some smart people invented "a version control system" to solve this. 

## Git basics

__Teacher:__ A version control system is a computer program. Its job is to create versions of your files without renaming them. There are many different types of version control systems. The one we are going to learn is "Git".
